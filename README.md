Notes:
Umbraco CMS is used and recommended for independent install through the proper channels (so it is not in the repository).
Also required is the Netaddicts.GMaps plugin.

The CMS has some custom data types that are needed, and can be requested from the developers here.

Contact one of us to be added to the Production CMS instance.
